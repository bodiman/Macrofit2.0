# Macrofit
At Macrofit, we don't believe in documentation. This README is used to track bugs that are too small to warrant immediate troubleshooting.

### Bug List

1. Opening Add food causes the icons loaded from fontawesome to blink. Convert these into SVGs and the problem will go away.

2. This is really fucking annoying me, but the current solution for closing the result content is incredibly fucking jank. I have a random ass block 5000 pixels tall extending down the screen to be clicked on. It's so fucking stupid and hardcoded but it works for now. I just worry it's going to cause some insufferable bugs sometime down the road. Fix this if you ever get the chance.
